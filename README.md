# Pacmen
## Pacmen coding exercise
-This is an exercise where you have two buttons one to add pacmen on the screen (one with each click) and a start button to make them move around the screen and bounce off of the walls. 

-To run this, get the .index repo and load it on your machine. From there just open up the new repo in your browser and run it as instructed above. 

-The future plans for this repo are to get the pacmen to be more animated (opening and closing mouths) and adding ghosts to the page.
