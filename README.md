# Pacmen
## Pacmen coding exercise
-This is an exercise where you have two buttons one to add pacmen on the screen (one with each click) and a start button to make them move around the screen and bounce off of the walls. 

-To run this, get the .index repo and load it on your machine. From there just open up the new repo in your browser and run it as instructed above. Hit the start button repeatedly to speed up the pacmen. 

-The future plans for this repo are to get the pacmen to be more animated (opening and closing mouths) and adding ghosts to the page.
